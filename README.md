# scheduling-algorithms

Assignment for CS 433 Operating Systems
April 2021

Objectives
- Use C++ to implement first-come-first-served (FCFS), shortest-job-first (SJF), priority, and round-robin (RR) scheduling.
- Extra credit attempted but not completed: Use C++ to implement a combination of priority and RR scheduling.
- Use a Makefile to build executables for each algorithm
- Test the algorithms using a text file that provides a list of tasks along with their priorites and next CPU burst lengths

Tools used
- Putty (SSH)
- SFTP (WinSCP)
- Visual Studio Code & repl.it (IDEs)
